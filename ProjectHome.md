Apache Ivy is an incredible project and tool. However, it generally sticks out a bit from the existing toolbag that developers have in the a modern tool stack. Maintaining a team repository is generally on sftp, or ssh access, or worse just a directory listing on a webserver.. and not versioned. It's difficult to close the gap.. and really make sure you hard revision internal artifacts and third party artifacts.

IvyMeetSvn allows you to maintain your ivy artifact repository in your already existing Subversion stack.

Note: This is for ivy 1.4.1, and NOT the beta Ivy 2.0. You should use the [IvySvn](http://http://www.audioscrobbler.net/development/ivysvn/) project if you're already on 2.0.
